# getwad
A simple Python script for fetching Doom WADs from the (old) /idgames archive

Finds a download link for the .zip file, downloads it, moves any .txt files into a txt directory, renames any files as needed to help keep relevant WADs together, and performs post-download cleanup as necessary.
